# WordCounter
Save the JavaScript code in a file called script.js and the HTML code in a file called index.html both in the same directory. 
The "Word Counter" application with a textarea and a button should then be visible whe n you view the index.html file in a web browser.
The "Count Words" button will count the number of times each word appears in the text you enter when you click it,
and the results will be shown below the button in decreasing order of frequency.
